# 09-Good-README-Generator
## Introduction:
Our task was to create a command-line application. That dynamically generates a new README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. While it’s not a well kept secret, it’s important to have a high-quality README for all apps that we create.

 A README file is like a manual. It should include what the app is for, how to use it, how to install, to report issues, and how to make contributions to the app. 


I created a demo that you can view on this link:
